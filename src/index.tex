Ethernet is a set of systems standardising 2-way device-to-device digital data exchange and communication over physical cabling.
Devices within an Ethernet network are referred to as \textbf{stations}; stations exchange \textbf{frames}: variable-length, self-contained, addressed sequences of bits which are typically single-station-to-single-station (though ``multicast'' modes of operation are available)~\cite{IEEEStandardEthernet2022}\cite{spurgeonEthernetDefinitiveGuide2000}.

The basic Ethernet standard (see \cite{IEEEStandardEthernet2022}) does not provide any mechanism to guarantee delivery of frames, nor the time taken to do so.
It provides a basic system for receiving stations to detect errors during frame transmission to a reasonable accuracy using a checksum algorithm attached to each frame\footnote{ARINC 629 likewise provides a checksum~\cite{dheerajpuniaARINC629Digital2021}, though the guarantee of integrity is weaker owing to the simplicity of the algorithm and the length of the single parity bit.}, but no method for recovery from this error --- the frame is simply dropped~\cite{odomCCNA200301Official2019}.
The protocol does not provide any way for a frame's transmission to be interrupted.

Ethernet offers two methods of operation pertinent to resource management:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \label{def:halfduplex} \textbf{Half-Duplex} offers links between devices which are only available to transmit on by a single station at a time.
        This is managed through a mechanism known as the \textbf{Media Access Control Protocol}, which is embedded in each station's Ethernet controller.
        Under this system, stations must listen to the link to determine if it is in use, then attempt to transmit their next frame; if two stations try to transmit a frame at the same time, a \textbf{collision} occurs and both devices must ``back off'' and attempt to re-transmit their frame in the same manner a random time offset in the future.
    \item \label{def:fullduplex} \textbf{Full-Duplex} offers links between devices which may be both transmitted and received on at the same time~\cite{spurgeonEthernetDefinitiveGuide2000}.
        This mode can only be enabled on point-to-point links which have exactly two stations with all hardware being compatible, including cabling.
        Under this system, the link is split into TX and RX channels which may be utilised simultaneously, eliminating the need to manage collisions and the MAC Protocol.
        Higher throughput and more predictable timing may be conferred by this, but this is not guaranteed; other sources of nondeterministic time still exist within the system.
        Furthermore, for networks with many stations, switches (see below) or some other form of routing are required.
\end{itemize}

In systems with many stations which all need to transmit different data to each other, it may be desirable to add in \textbf{Switches}\footnote{Sometimes referred to as \textbf{Switching Hubs}~\cite{spurgeonEthernetDefinitiveGuide2000}.}.
These are stations with many connection ports that function as address-aware relays: they automatically segment the network by station residency and only forward frames to segment(s) connected to the addressee\cite{spurgeonEthernetDefinitiveGuide2000}.
A switch may allow more efficient link utilisation, and fewer collisions to occur in Half-Duplex operation.
They can also allow economic hybridisation of hardware in networks, with higher-throughput links between switches and ``downgraded'' links between switches and non-switch stations as required.

% - originates from audio-visual-bridging task group
%   - founded in 2005
%   - determined that the standard was useful for industrial automation applications~\cite{imtiazProposalIntegrateProcess2011}
%   - then renamed in 2012~\cite{zezulkaTimeSensitiveNetworkingCommunication2019} to the more general "Time Sensitive Networking"
% - IEEE standard for TSNs in aviation is in development: \cite{P8021DPTSN}

\subsection{Mixed Criticality System with TSNs}
% Part C: ~1.5 pages

% - use example situation
% - use different VLANs for different subsystems, with appropriately assigned priority tags
%   - choose a mapping from DAL class (A-E in the example) to priority tag (1-8)?
% - assumptions:
%   - FCS must receive constant data from NS with a guaranteed delivery rate and time
% - insert command system representing information issued by pilot(s) or autopiloting system

Following the given rubric example, and making the following assumptions about it:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flight Control System} encompasses the control surfaces and the actuation systems related to them
    \item \textbf{Power Distribution System} refers to routing of electrical power across the aircraft
    \item \textbf{Fuel Management System} encompasses fuel tank status data and control for inter-tank fuel transfer and balancing
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{Command System} is inserted, and defined as the systems that interface with the crew (primarily pilots) of the aircraft and allow them to issue commands to and view the status of other systems; in addition to encompassing ``auto-pilot'' capabilities.
