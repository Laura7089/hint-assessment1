This allows much more freedom in the exchange of data between units in the avionics system. ARINC 629 has the ability to accommodate up to a total of 128 terminals on a data bus and supports a data rate of 2 Mbit/s. The ARINC 629 data bus was developed by the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) to replace the ARINC 429 bus. The ARINC 629 data bus was based on the Boeing DATAC bus.},

  abstract = {The functionality advancements and novel customer features that are currently found in modern automotive systems require high-bandwidth and low-latency in-vehicle communications, which become even more compelling for autonomous vehicles. In a recent effort to meet these requirements, the IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group has developed a set of standards that introduce novel features in Switched Ethernet. TSN standards offer, for example, a common notion of time through accurate and reliable clock synchronization, delay bounds for real-time traffic, time-driven transmissions, improved reliability, and much more. In order to fully utilize the potential of these novel protocols in the automotive domain, TSN should be seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art and state-of-practice model-based development processes for automotive embedded systems. Some of the core phases in these processes include software architecture modeling, timing predictability verification, simulation, and hardware realization and deployment. Moreover, throughout the development of automotive embedded systems, the safety and security requirements specified on these systems need to be duly taken into account. In this context, this work provides an overview of TSN in automotive applications and discusses the recent technological developments relevant to the adoption of TSN in automotive embedded systems. The work also points at the open challenges and future research directions.},

In particular IEEE 802.1Qbv is key to enabling timeliness guarantees via so-called time-aware shapers. In this paper, we address the computation of fully deterministic schedules for 802.1Qbv-compliant multi-hop switched networks. We identify and analyze key functional parameters affecting the deterministic behaviour of real-time communication under 802.1Qbv and, based on a generalized configuration of these parameters, derive the required constraints for computing offline schedules guaranteeing low and bounded jitter and deterministic end-to-end latency for critical communication flows. Furthermore, we discuss several optimization directions and concrete configurations exposing trade-offs against the required computation time. We also show the performance of our approach via synthetic network workloads on top of different network configurations.},

A number of vendors are offering industrial communication products based on Ethernet and TCP/IP as a means to interconnect field devices to the first level of automation. Others restrict their offer to communication between automation devices such as programmable logic controllers and provide integration means to existing fieldbuses. This paper first details the requirements that an industrial network has to fulfill. It then shows how Ethernet has been enhanced to comply with the real-time requirements in particular in the industrial context. Finally, we show how the requirements that cannot be fulfilled at layer 2 of the OSI model can be addressed in the higher layers adding functionality to existing standard protocols.},

Most, if not all, computers have a built-in Ethernet interface. These are just some of the reasons why an increasing number of industrial automation vendors militate for the use of Ethernet - as is or with modifications - to support communications on the shop floor. They've made a number of proposals under the generic name "industrial Ethernet," all aimed at the specificities of communications in the industrial environment. Most of the time, however, these proposals are incompatible. Limiting ourselves to the temporal aspects, we look at why Ethernet is generally considered inadequate as a support for computer communications on the factory floor. We also examine possible modifications to obtain an adequate solution based on Ethernet and the proposals that have been recently standardized under IEC 61158 and IEC 61784.},

  abstract = {Ethernet ( EE-th{$\Elzschwa$}r-net) is a family of wired computer networking technologies commonly used in local area networks (LAN), metropolitan area networks (MAN) and wide area networks (WAN).  It was commercially introduced in 1980 and first standardized in 1983 as IEEE 802.3. Ethernet has since been refined to support higher bit rates, a greater number of nodes, and longer link distances, but retains much backward compatibility. Over time, Ethernet has largely replaced competing wired LAN technologies such as Token Ring, FDDI and ARCNET. The original 10BASE5 Ethernet uses a thick coaxial cable as a shared medium. This was largely superseded by 10BASE2, which used a thinner and more flexible cable that was both cheaper and easier to use. More modern Ethernet variants use twisted pair and fiber optic links in conjunction with switches. Over the course of its history, Ethernet data transfer rates have been increased from the original 2.94 Mbit/s to the latest 400 Gbit/s, with rates up to 1.6 Tbit/s under development. The Ethernet standards include several wiring and signaling variants of the OSI physical layer. Systems communicating over Ethernet divide a stream of data into shorter pieces called frames. Each frame contains source and destination addresses, and error-checking data so that damaged frames can be detected and discarded; most often, higher-layer protocols trigger retransmission of lost frames. Per the OSI model, Ethernet provides services up to and including the data link layer. The 48-bit MAC address was adopted by other IEEE 802 networking standards, including IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), as well as by FDDI. EtherType values are also used in Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) headers. Ethernet is widely used in homes and industry, and interworks well with wireless Wi-Fi technologies. The Internet Protocol is commonly carried over Ethernet and so it is considered one of the key technologies that make up the Internet.},

  abstract = {The groundbreaking transformations triggered by the Industry 4.0 paradigm have dramatically reshaped the requirements for control and communication systems within the factory systems of the future. The aforementioned technological revolution strongly affects industrial smart and distributed measurement systems as well, pointing to ever more integrated and intelligent equipment devoted to derive accurate measurements. Moreover, as factory automation uses ever wider and complex smart distributed measurement systems, the well-known Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm finds its viability also in the industrial context, namely Industrial IoT (IIoT). In this context, communication networks and protocols play a key role, directly impacting on the measurement accuracy, causality, reliability and safety. The requirements coming both from Industry 4.0 and the IIoT, such as the coexistence of time-sensitive and best effort traffic, the need for enhanced horizontal and vertical integration, and interoperability between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), fostered the development of enhanced communication subsystems. Indeed, established technologies, such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi, widespread in the consumer and office fields, are intrinsically non-deterministic and unable to support critical traffic. In the last years, the IEEE 802.1 Working Group defined an extensive set of standards, comprehensively known as Time Sensitive Networking (TSN), aiming at reshaping the Ethernet standard to support for time-, mission- and safety-critical traffic. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of the TSN Working Group standardization activity is provided, while contextualizing TSN within the complex existing industrial technological panorama, particularly focusing on industrial distributed measurement systems. In particular, this paper has to be considered a technical review of the most important features of TSN, while underlining its applicability to the measurement field. Furthermore, the adoption of TSN within the Wi-Fi technology is addressed in the last part of the survey, since wireless communication represents an appealing opportunity in the industrial measurement context. In this respect, a test case is presented, to point out the need for wirelessly connected sensors networks. In particular, by reviewing some literature contributions it has been possible to show how wireless technologies offer the flexibility necessary to support advanced mobile IIoT applications.},

The notion of a small and predictable latency is common for both industrial and multimedia (audio, video) applications. The inbuilt characteristics of 802.1 AVB that includes synchronization, real-time traffic scheduling \& shaping and resource reservation makes it a real-time capable Ethernet solution, which can be used for the process control applications as well.

  abstract = {Industrial Ethernet (IE) is the use of Ethernet in an industrial environment with protocols that provide determinism and real-time control. Protocols for industrial Ethernet include EtherCAT, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET, POWERLINK, SERCOS III, CC-Link IE, and Modbus TCP. Many industrial Ethernet protocols use a modified  media access control (MAC) layer to provide low latency and determinism. Some microprocessors provide industrial Ethernet support. Industrial Ethernet can also refer to the use of standard Ethernet protocols with rugged connectors and extended temperature switches in an industrial environment, for automation or process control. Components used in plant process areas must be designed to work in harsh environments of temperature extremes, humidity, and vibration that exceed the ranges for information technology equipment intended for installation in controlled environments. The use of fiber-optic Ethernet variants reduces the problems of electrical noise and provides electrical isolation.  Some industrial networks emphasized deterministic delivery of transmitted data, whereas Ethernet used collision detection which made transport time for individual data packets difficult to estimate with increasing network traffic. Typically, industrial uses of Ethernet employ full-duplex standards and other methods so that collisions do not unacceptably influence transmission times.},

  abstract = {Networks are a core element of many industrial and automation systems at present. Often these networks transport time- and safety-critical messages that control physical processes. Thus, timely and guaranteed delivery is an essential property of networks for such critical systems. Over the past decade, a variety of network solutions have evolved to satisfy said properties. However, these solutions are largely incompatible with each other and many system architects are forced to deploy different solutions in parallel due to their different capabilities. IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a standardization group that enhances IEEE networking standards, most prominently Ethernet-based networks, with said properties and has the unique potential to evolve as a cross-industry mainstream networking technology. In this survey paper, we give an overview of TSN in industrial communication and automation systems and discuss specific TSN standards and projects in detail as well as their applicability to various industries.},

The on-going standardisation of TSN is an IEEE effort to bring deterministic real-time capabilities into the IEEE 802.1 Ethernet standard supporting safety-critical systems and guaranteed quality-of-service. TSN will support time-triggered (TT) communication based on schedule tables, audio-video-bridging (AVB) flows with bounded end-to-end latency as well as best-effort messages. The authors first present a survey of research related to the optimisation of distributed cyber-physical systems using real-time Ethernet for communication. Then, the authors formulate two novel optimisation problems related to the scheduling and routing of TT and AVB traffic in TSN. Thus, the authors consider that they know the topology of the network as well as the set of TT and AVB flows. The authors are interested to determine the routing of both TT and AVB flows as well as the scheduling of the TT flows such that all frames are schedulable and the AVB worst-case end-to-end delay is minimised. The authors have proposed an integer linear programming formulation for the scheduling problem and a greedy randomised adaptive search procedure-based heuristic for the routing problem. The proposed approaches have been evaluated using several test cases.},

We review more than 170 TSN-related academic research papers published by major academic publishers and categorize these studies according to the topic, purpose, and methodology, analyzing research trends in TSN. The TSN core function deals with the functional and internal perspective to achieve ultra-low latency/jitter and ultra-reliability. Network management includes work with macroscopic and external views, such as configuration, management, and maintenance of TSN-enabled networks. In particular, we analyze the characteristics of existing studies that have evaluated the TSN network and propose future directions to advance the limits of TSN for real-world deployment.

Apart from LAN installations, Ethernet became also attractive for many other fields of application, ranging from industry to avionics, telecommunication, and multimedia. The expanded application of this technology is mainly due to its significant assets like reduced cost, backward-compatibility, flexibility, and expandability. However, this new trend raises some problems concerning the services of the protocol and the requirements for each application. Therefore, specific adaptations prove essential to integrate this communication technology in each field of application. Our primary objective is to show how Ethernet has been enhanced to comply with the specific requirements of several application fields, particularly in transport, embedded and multimedia contexts. The paper first describes the common Ethernet LAN technology and highlights its main features. It reviews the most important specific Ethernet versions with respect to each application field's requirements. Finally, we compare these different fields of application and we particularly focus on the fundamental concepts and the quality of service capabilities of each proposal.},

While the basic protocols have changed little, new options such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet have increased the complexity of the topic.Ethernet has been the flavor of choice for networking administrators since the early 1980s because of its ease of use and scalability. Written by one of the foremost experts on Ethernet standards and configuration, Charles E. Spurgeon, Ethernet: The Definitive Guide includes everything you need to know to set up and maintain an Ethernet network. Ethernet: The Definitive Guide teaches you everything you need to know about the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and its protocols. The book is logically separated into five parts:  Introduction to Ethernet provides a tour of basic Ethernet theory and operation, including a description of Ethernet frames, operation of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, full-duplex mode and auto-negotiation. Ethernet Media Systems is the heart of the book. This sectionof Ethernet: The Definitive Guide shows you how to build media-specific Ethernet networks, from a basic 10BASE-T Ethernet offering 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cables, to an advanced 1000BASE-X Gigabit Ethernet, providing up to 1 Gbps of data transfer over fiber optic cables. Building Your Ethernet System teaches you how to build twisted-pair and fiber optic media segments, as well as how to build your Ethernet using repeaters and hubs. Performance and Troubleshooting is divided into two chapters. The first describes both the performance of a given Ethernet channel, as well as the performance of the entire network system. The second includes a tutorial on troubleshooting techniques and describes the kinds of problems network administrators are likely to encounter.  The last part of the book includes a complete glossary of terms used throughout the book, a resource list, descriptions of thick and thin coax-based Ethernet systems, a guide to AUI equipment installation and configuration, and a listing of troubleshooting numbers.This book is the definitive guide for anyone wanting to build a scalable local area network (LAN) using Ethernet.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses new trends within communication protocols of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing especially on the enhancement of the IoT's real-time abilities and summarizing the long-term knowledge and experience of the authors. Considering the previous standardization attempts of the ISO and IEEE, we may expect that the novel research projects will facilitate major progress in real-time communication systems to satisfy common requirements of industrial automation, information and audiovisual technologies, mechanical engineering, management, banking, medical care, and multiple other sectors covered by the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, time-sensitive networks (TSNs) appear to embody a most effective approach to securing reliable communication for the future.},
